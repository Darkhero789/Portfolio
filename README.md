# Overview

This is a portfolio designated for any and all programs i make to help me reach my end goal of designing and creating my own video games. I don't know what i will create on my journey to being my own video game designer and creating games i enjoy, however i plan on putting anything that can be helpful to me in my goal here in this portfolio. That can be anything from a basic video game i created to a randomizer that can help create ideas for me. I don't really know what i will put here in the coming years, but i think it will be great. 

The software i have in this portfolio as of right now include a hello world program that i used to create the portfolio in the first place. 

My purpose in creating the hello world program is to show i know basic python and know how to publish and work along with github, because if i plan to create games and publish them onto github i need to know how to put them into github. Think of it as practice for future endeavors. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The only tool used was Visual Studio Code as i used it for creating the very simple program of hello world. Outside of that i used github to publish it.

I used python programming language to create this simple program as it is the programming language i know the most. Python is a very simple language with simple commands. You want the program to print something you use the command print(). You want to remember a value then you simply create one like so, x = 1. python is straightforward and simple.
